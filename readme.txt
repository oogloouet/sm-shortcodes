SM shortcodes allow you to insert awesome shortcodes right through your tinymce editor without requiring you to type in the shortcodes.

== Description ==

SM Shortcodes registers a button in tinymce editor in wordpress and allows you to easily embed shortoces snippets to your pages and posts through mouse clicks without requiring you to type in the shortcodes.

You can select from many shortcodes that are available in this plugin like, buttons, alerts, tabs, accordions, prompt messages, Google maps, images, videos, line, verticle gap, social shares, columns, code, custom heading, Dropcap, Progress bars. Fill in the appropriate fields and click on the `OK` button and you are DONE !

Please note that this will not work with every theme as some theme developers will overwrite styling, as such I cannot provide support if there are formatting issues with your site.
